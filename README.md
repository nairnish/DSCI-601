# Information on the Dataset: #
DSLCC 4.0 Corpus
================

This is the training and test data for the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) task at VarDial 2017.

#### The package contains the following files: ####

1. DSL-TRAIN.txt 						- Training set for the DSL task
2. DSL-DEV.txt 							- Development set for the DSL task
3. DSL-DEV.txt 							- Unlabelled test set
4. DSL-TEST-UNLABELLED.txt 	- Test set with gold labels
5. README.txt 								- Brief description of the DSL data

Each line in the .txt files are tab-delimited in the format:
sentence<tab>language-label
